1) License
===========

UIXGridView is released under a BSD license.  The project that prompted its creation was itself using a number of other open source packages and we thought this would be a good way to give back.

Here is the license proper:

2) What it is
==============

UIXGridView implements a row/column type view that can be constrained to the screen horizontally, vertically, both or neither.  It follows a model similar to UITableView in that it has a datasource and delegate that affect what is displayed and respond to user actions.  Items in the table are represented by "cells" that can be used as is or subclassed for you own needs.

3) What still needs to be done
===============================

UIXGridView was written to scratch my own itch, so it is not necessarily a fully general use View subclass.  One main shortcoming is it does not implement a smart cell reuse mechanism like the one UITableView uses.  I hope to implement it, but don't hold your breath waiting on me.
